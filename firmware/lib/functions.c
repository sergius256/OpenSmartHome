/*
  Each single device recieves its unique identifier by redefining ADDR
  constant inside main source file. These unique identifiers plays
  role similar to MAC addresses in network controllers.

  Communication inside controllers network is based on queries sent by
  server and answers given by slaves. Server needs to know identifiers
  of all devices connected to it. Server query starts with a plaintext
  containing "DEV" keyword concatenated with slaves identifier,
  i.e. "DEV01000001AT\n" means "Attention to device with ID 01000001.
  The length of such query preamble is always the same, i.e. when
  4-byte ID is used, preamble is 11 bytes of plain text long.

  So INIT_LEN constant points to this preamble length.

  BUFFER_LEN constant defines the maximum length of string recieved or
  transmitted by slave.
